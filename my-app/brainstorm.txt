play again feature
- get a new solution
- reset constants (history, guessed words, key colors, etc.)
- make isCorrect null

idea:
- create boolean variable (false)
- make true when button is clicked
- add variable as dependency in App.js to get a new solution when button is clicked

- maybe get constant from a PlayAgain.js file like how Wordle.js gets constants from useWordle.js file
- add same constant into Wordle.js so in line 43 you can add it as a constant for Modal.js line 3
- i think export a function that changes the variable from true to false that can be called with button onclick
- hopefully this will serve to reset the useeffect in App.js and get a new solution

- next figure out how to reset everything else
